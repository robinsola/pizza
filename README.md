# Phone Home Pizza

## Description
With this website application, you start by making selections on a form, pretty much building a pizza from scratch. You have the choice of many options for crust, sauce, vegan cheese, vegan meats, and toppings. Meats and toppings use a checklist, so you may choose as many as you like. After the form, there is an area to type in your name, credit card information, and address to be delivered to. Once you submit your order, the webpage changes to show you the type of pizza you ordered with the total of what it will cost.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Clone the repository from github: https://github.com/robinsola/pizza.git to your desktop
* Double click the folder "pizza" to open it
* Double click the file "index.html" or drag that file to a web browser
* Once it opens, order a pizza!

## Known Bugs
The website works fine right now. Eventually, I would like to create a button to order multiple pizzas to add to your order.
